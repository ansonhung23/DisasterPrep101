# DisasterPrep101 Club Website

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the DisasterPrep101 Club Website. This project represents my first endeavor into building a website from scratch, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

This website has responsive layout function, which could be viewed user-friendly in both PC and mobile.

Please note that the "DisasterPrep101 Club" is a fictional entity and all the external links and the contact information provided are purely fictitious. 

## Structure

The website consists of five primary HTML pages, each styled with its own CSS and enhanced with JavaScript functions:

### 1. Home (./index.html)

This is the landing page for the website. It includes a welcoming message and a chatbox where visitors can send inquiries. A list of fictional online friends is also included. There is a JavaScript alert function that provides further information when the "send" button is clicked.

### 2. About Us (./about-us.html)

This page introduces the DisasterPrep101 Club, including the club's mission, vision, and history. It provides insight into the club's aims and objectives, as well as its dedication towards educating members about disaster preparedness.

### 3. Past Activities(./past-activities.html)

This page showcases past activities conducted by the DisasterPrep101 Club. It includes images and descriptions of two fictional activities, with a JavaScript mouseover function that changes the image.

### 4. Join Us (./join-us.html)

This page includes a form for those interested in joining the DisasterPrep101 Club. The form requires name, email, and phone number, and has pattern validation for each input. On form submission, a JavaScript function generates a confirmation message.

### 5. Contact Us (./contact-us.html)

This page provides fabricated contact information for the DisasterPrep101 Club, including the address, phone number, and operating hours. It also includes an embedded Google Maps iframe indicating the club's location, as well as links to the club's (fictional) social media profiles.

## Conclusion

Building this website has been a great learning experience. It offered an opportunity to apply the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to understand how these technologies interact to create dynamic and interactive web experiences. The fabricated "DisasterPrep101 Club" served as an engaging theme to design around, fostering a sense of purpose in the learning journey.

I hope you enjoy exploring this beginner's project as much as I enjoyed creating it!
